# Password-Strength-Checker
A simple python script to check password strength
This script defines a function check_password_strength() that takes a password as input and returns a string indicating whether the password is considered "Weak" or "Strong". The function checks the length of the password, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, and the presence of digits. It also checks for common patterns or substrings that are often found in weak passwords.

To test the password strength checker, you can call the function and pass it a password as input. The function will return a string indicating the strength of the password.
